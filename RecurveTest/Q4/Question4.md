Taking this test was a great example of my ability to "start as a specialist and grow towards a generalist". I primarily write programs in JavaScript and based on my previous experience with HackerRank, I thought I was going to have a choice of languages. Before this test, I had written zero lines of code in Python and spent one day during my boot camp working with SQL, six months ago. That being said, I had a blast solving these problems using new languages. If Recurve writes programs exclusively with these technologies, I am happy to add them to my vocabulary. 

I've had lots of experience working remotely and independently and I also strongly believe in fortifying productive habits and rituals to be successful in all aspects of life. I am excited to go back and connect with my work group of fellow grads to share my experience and suggest putting practice problems in different languages onto our agenda. While I hope I've proved that I can work efficiently on my own, I really enjoy working with a team to overcome obstacles together. I would love the opportunity to continue to show your company how I align with Recurve's values, by being flexible, being adaptable, thinking on my feet, and welcoming bigger and bigger challenges.
